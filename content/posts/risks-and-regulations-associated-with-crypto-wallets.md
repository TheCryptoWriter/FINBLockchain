As a compliance consultant for investment advisors, it is essential to keep abreast of the latest rules and guidelines issued by regulatory bodies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). One area that has seen a significant amount of attention in recent years is the unique risks and regulations associated with management of crypto assets by registered investment advisors (RIAs).

## RIA Due Diligence and Compliance

The SEC has issued guidance stating that certain digital assets may be considered securities and therefore subject to federal securities laws. 

FINRA has also warned investors about the possible risks of crypto assets, such as the lack of regulation and the possibility of fraud. 

As such, RIAs should conduct thorough due diligence on any crypto assets they are considering adding to their clients' portfolios and ensure that any investments in these assets comply with applicable laws and regulations.

This means that anyone who offers financial advice or manages funds that include cryptocurrencies must comply with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, just as they would for any other security. This includes the requirements to register with the SEC as an investment advisor, adhere to the fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients, and disclose any conflicts of interest.

 

## Custody of Client Assets

Another important consideration for RIAs is the custody of client assets. Under SEC guidelines, an RIA must have possession or control of the assets they are managing. This means that if an RIA is managing a client's crypto assets, they must have a secure way to store those assets, such as a crypto wallet.

A crypto wallet is a digital wallet that lets you store, send, and receive digital assets like cryptocurrencies; there are many types. As such, RIAs should thoroughly research and select a crypto wallet that meets their needs and the needs of their clients.

### Types of Crypto Wallets: Cold Wallets vs. Hot Wallets

Closed wallets, also known as "cold wallets" or offline hardware wallets, are considered the most secure form of crypto storage. They are disconnected from the internet and not susceptible to hacking attempts. They store your private keys on a physical device that is separate from your computer or smartphone. Some popular hardware wallet options include Trezor, Ledger, and KeepKey. These wallets are ideal for long-term storage of large amounts of cryptocurrency.

Custodial wallets, also known as "hot wallets," are stored online and require you to cede control of your private keys to a third party, like a cryptocurrency exchange. It is never a good idea to trust your coins to a centralized exchange platform. As the saying goes, "Not your keys, not your coins." Investors have repeatedly suffered insurmountable losses by making this mistake. In the most recent example, when the FTX exchange crashed, the original reports estimated the damage to be around $10 billion in investor funds lost.

 

## Policy for Managing and Protecting Client Assets

In addition to selecting a secure crypto wallet, RIAs should also have a clear policy in place for managing and protecting client assets. This should include regular reviews of the security of the wallet as well as a plan for what to do in case of a security breach.

### Staying Informed and Compliant

In summary, the use of crypto wallets by RIAs is an area that requires a great deal of attention and care. By being aware of the potential risks and taking steps to address them, RIAs can fulfill their fiduciary duty to their clients and comply with regulatory requirements. This includes conducting due diligence, selecting a secure crypto wallet, and staying informed about the latest rules and guidelines.

In addition to these specific considerations, it is also important to stay informed about any relevant press releases or other guidance issued by the SEC, FINRA, or state regulators. This can help make sure that RIAs are aware of any new developments or changes to the rules that are already in place so that they can make changes to their business practices.

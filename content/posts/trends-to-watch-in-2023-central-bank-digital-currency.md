The idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) has gained popularity since the Bank of England introduced it in its 2015 research agenda. In fact, one of the most important trends that continued to grow over the course of 2022 was the interest by central banks across the globe in further investigating the formation of central bank digital currencies (CBDC).

A CBDC is a central bank digital liability that is easily accessible to the general public. To put it another way, it is comparable to a digital version of paper currency. The general public would be able to make digital payments with a CBDC, as if it were cash in their wallets.

On the contrary, CBDC could give monetary policymakers the ability to influence spending patterns by restricting what goods and services can be bought with their digital assets, as well as the ability to automate tax collection through the use of smart contracts.

Governments and central banks are currently researching and evaluating CBDCs in order to fully comprehend the numerous positive effects they may have on financial inclusion, economic expansion, technological advancement, and enhanced transactional efficiency.

CBDC could also pose certain risks and raise a number of crucial policy questions, such as its potential impact on the market structure of the financial sector, the cost of credit, the security and stability of the financial system, and the efficacy of monetary policy.

Governments throughout the globe have recognized the potential of CBDCs and begun studying their implementation in their respective nations.

According to statistics published by the Atlantic Council, as of the end of the year, 114 nations, representing more than 95% of the world GDP, were in different phases of CBDC investigation. Sixty nations are at an advanced stage of exploration, including China and India, both of which are in the pilot testing phase.

Although no decisions have been made regarding whether or not to pursue a CBDC pegged to the US dollar, the Federal Reserve has signaled its interest. In January 2022, the Federal Reserve issued a report titled "Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital Transformation" that analyzed the potential benefits and risks of issuing a CBDC pegged to the US Dollar.

Benefits:

* safely meet future needs and demands for payment services;
* Improvements to Cross-Border Payments;
* Support the dollar’s international role;
* Financial Inclusion;
* Extend public access to safe central bank money.

Risks:

* Changes to financial-sector market structure;
* safety and stability of the financial system;
* Efficacy of Monetary Policy Implementation;
* Privacy and data protection, and the prevention of financial crimes;
* Operational Resilience and Cybersecurity.

The need to adapt to the increasingly digital nature of our lives and the growing irrelevance of cash within the economy have greatly contributed to the interest in the creation of CBDCs. Cash is the only form of central bank money that is currently accessible to the non-banking private sector.

As these digital currencies take shape, many central banks have formed partnerships with private companies and technology firms in order to create and maintain the necessary infrastructure for them. These partnerships include things like cloud computing, blockchain technology, cryptocurrency mining, and blockchain data storage. It's possible that the use of CBDCs could bridge the gap between physical cash and other digital payment services. 

CBDCs can be made accessible to the public in a variety of ways, including via mobile phones and digital wallets. By easing access to digital payments, CBDCs can enable more individuals to participate in the global economy and reap its benefits. It could also facilitate the transmission of monetary policy to households and businesses, as the money supply can be expanded or contracted based on the needs of the economy. These digital currencies would allow consumers to make payments directly to the central bank, rather than through a third party such as a bank or credit card company.

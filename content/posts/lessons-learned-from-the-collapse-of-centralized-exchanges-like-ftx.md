Despite ALL of the problems with fiat currency—problems that Bitcoin was supposed to solve—investors continue to trust centralized exchanges! From Mt. Gox in 2014 to FTX in 2022, centralized custody of user assets has consistently been identified as the primary source of harm to traders. The demand for transparency and decentralization has never been greater, and blockchain technology is the only solution.

Before its epic collapse, FTX was one of the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchanges prior to its bankruptcy. In 2021, FTX reported revenues of $1 billion, an increase of approximately 1,000% over the $85 million reported in 2020. Early in 2021, FXT reported having 1.2 million registered customers across its platforms and a 24-hour trading volume record of $21 billion.

On November 11, 2022, FTX crashed due to a shortage of $8 billion in customer cash, followed by FTX.us, Alameda, and hundreds of subsidiaries declaring bankruptcy the same day. Later that day, the FTX exchange suffered a cyberattack, resulting in the theft of more than $300 million. In response, the exchange asked customers to deactivate its mobile app. SBF later blamed an "ex-employee, or malware on an ex-computer," for the theft.

Following the bankruptcy and resignation, John J. Ray III, who infamously managed the collapse of Enron, replaced SBF as CEO. The new CEO characterized the organizational dysfunction at FTX as "unprecedented."

Sam Bankman-Fried founded both FTX, a centralized cryptocurrency exchange, and Alameda Research, a hedge fund investing business. Within the conventional banking industry, these two entities would be wholly independent or at the very least separated by divisions and firewalls.

However, Bankman-Fried had been utilizing the FTX cryptocurrency's FTT token as an asset for his trading firm, Alameda Research, to use as collateral for risky trades without even informing its customers. Basically, SBF had stolen and lost over $8 billion in customer funds by staking the money on high-risk betting. Consequently, criminal and regulatory authorities started examining FTX for possible violations of securities laws.

The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission launched an inquiry into whether FTX inappropriately utilized client cash to prop up Alameda Research, a crypto trading platform that Mr. Bankman-Fried had co-founded. Mr. Bankman-Fried was detained in the Bahamas on December 12 for deceiving investors and committing fraud. The next day, the SEC further filed civil fraud accusations.

SBF has only served to illustrate the hazards that uncontrolled, centralized institutions bring to the global financial system.

FTX is just one of several high-profile cryptocurrency failures in recent months.

In July, Celsius Network failed when its CEO, Alex Mashinsky, placed the company’s eggs in a single basket, a risky move to promise high yield returns (up to 18%), which necessitated a steady stream of user deposits. instead of a financial disaster when it was unable to pay back its consumers. Celsius still owes customers $4.7 billion.

BlockFi, yet another of the two fallen crypto investment funds, began to collapse in mid-2022. From January to June 2022, the company's valuation dropped from $5 billion to $400 million. That’s when Alameda Research, an SBF hedge fund business, came to the rescue with a $250 million credit line. The fall of FTX revealed that Alameda Research had directly borrowed from the centralized exchange's user funds. As a result of the FTX, BlockFi had no alternative but to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

All of the recent breakdowns in the crypto ecosystem were caused by centralized actors, not decentralized protocols, highlighting the most significant advantage decentralized exchanges have over their centralized equivalents.

The good news is that although market prices are low, leading DeFI initiatives are still attempting to resolve centralized issues. DeFI initiatives are pushing the limits of financial innovation, offering chances for users to circumvent centralized services and regain ownership over their assets. While centralized exchanges give more user accessibility, decentralized exchanges are more secure.

The collapse of the FTX exchange, according to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, has shown "weaknesses" in crypto. Concurrently, there was no regulation in place to address the liquidity problem of FTX or prevent the collapse from wiping out billions of dollars' worth of digital assets. This event emphasizes the necessity of regulating cryptocurrencies and centralized and decentralized businesses associated with cryptocurrencies.

The blockchain was founded on the promise of decentralization but has now become centralized in the hands of a few who have begun to misuse their authority. The difficulties that plagued FTX were not caused by a fundamental flaw in the technology, but rather by blatant fraud perpetrated by a huge, centralized exchange that covertly gambled with customer funds.

Platforms are developed on top of smart contracts in DeFi. A smart contract is basically blockchain-based software that executes when certain criteria are satisfied. Decentralized exchange protocols execute matching buy and sell orders automatically, without the need for a third party, and are compatible with bitcoin's fundamental ideals.

The failure of the centralized exchange FTX might result in regulatory changes in the cryptocurrency industry. It could also direct more activity into DeFi protocols.

JPMorgan views FTX's demise as a "huge short-term setback," but one that might prompt industry-wide transformation. Analysts at JPMorgan noted, "We believe the publicly reported collapse of FTX has the potential to drastically accelerate the implementation of crypto-related legislation."

Competing to regulate cryptocurrencies are the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). According to experts, crypto regulation falls under the authority of the CFTC. Nonetheless, the SEC has extended its oversight of crypto projects and corporations until 2022.
